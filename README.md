# HTML, CSS and JavaScript - learning the basics

catoberge.no is my first attempt at really using vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
I wanted to learn more about the basic frontend-tools and deliberately stayed away from any kind of frameworks.
This might change, but for now I am sticking with what I have used so far.
